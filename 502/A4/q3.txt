Q: Which is more efficient: top1m.collect()[0:50] or top1m.take(50)? Why? 
-----------------

top1m.take(50) is more efficient. Becuase collect() action collect all elements of RDD and send it to master.
If we use it on the big dataset, sometimes it might be give out of memory.
So filter the data before use collect() or use take and sampleTake action.
